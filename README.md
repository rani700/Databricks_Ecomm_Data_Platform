# 🛒 E-Commerce GenAI Data Agent (End-to-End Data Engineering Project)
This project demonstrates an **End-to-End Generative AI Data Platform** that enables business users to query massive e-commerce datasets using natural language. 

Built on the **Databricks Data Intelligence Platform**, it leverages a Medallion Architecture (Bronze/Silver/Gold) for data processing and a custom **AI Agent (Llama 3.3)** hosted in a Streamlit App. The agent translates English questions into optimized Spark SQL queries, allowing for instant data retrieval without requiring SQL knowledge.
